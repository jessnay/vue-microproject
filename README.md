## Project Instructions: 
You can use my recording and the Vue tutorial video for learning the essentials of Vue.JS and as a general guideline about the Vue components that you need to include in your project, but for sure you will have to:

come up with different idea about the project (the topic of your website). You will need to use a different case scenario
use your skills in front-end design like styles, layout, color themes, images, and multimedia to create a website with a professional look. Yes, you can use Bootstrap or any other framework you prefer
add comments for your code. Should be well explained comments
create at least 2 web pages
